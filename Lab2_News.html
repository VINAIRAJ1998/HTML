  <hr>
  <p>In a year marked by the devastating second wave of Covid-19, Keralaâ€™s all-cause mortality numbers are likely to touch a record high, with 2021 already recording the highest number of January-June deaths in recent years.</p>
  
  <p>In the first six months of the year, Kerala registered 1,55,520 all-cause deaths â€” a 35 percentage jump from the corresponding period in 2020 (1,15,081 deaths), a year of Covid-imposed lockdown, and a 21 percentage jump from the toll in the first six months of the pre-pandemic year of 2019 (1,28,667 deaths).</p>
  
  <p>Data from the stateâ€™s chief registrar of births and deaths show that the months of May and June this year recorded a sharp rise in registered deaths over the corresponding period in previous years.June 2021 was the worst in terms of mortality in recent years, with the state reporting 32,501 all-cause deaths â€” a 57 per cent jump over the 20,640 all-cause deaths reported in June 2020 and 20,642 deaths recorded in June 2019.In May this year, the state registered 28,684 deaths â€” a 33.4 per cent jump over May 2020 (21,488 deaths) and a 24.8 per cent jump over the 22,984 deaths recorded in May 2019.In these two months, Kerala also reported the highest daily Covid-19 deaths, around 150-200 deaths a day. From May 1 to July 1, the state recorded 7,927 deaths â€“ this does not include the numbers added after the health departmentâ€™s Covid-19 death reconciliation exercise revised the list after hearing appeals of those whose names were not included in the original list of victims.</p>
